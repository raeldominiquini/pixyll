Digital manufacturing has been around for a long time, used for the first time in 1952 in the production complex aircraft parts, but now it is more accessible than ever. As there are currently much cheaper equipment (10 years ago they costed 10 times more than today), more and more people can use these machines to make their ideas, and so ordinary citizens can finally produce their own objects with the same technology and precision of large companies. Digital fabrication is often called Fast Prototyping as it allows us to test a product idea in a short time.

Digital fabrication combines advantages of precise computer files and the physical objects around us. The manufacturing instructions, which are stored on a computer file can be infinitely copied and distributed without losing quality. Thus, a product that I model in Portugal, can be sent to Brazil by email and be produced there.

Shipping and storage costs can be avoided as the production as the production can be separated from the planning. The product exists only as a virtual file until its manufacturing is required. With the digital fabrication machines, there are no molds or costly forms, so it is extremely easy to test multiple changes to a design. An example of an opposite technology is the plastic injection, where each change of the design corresponds to a change of the production machine (which is very expensive and limits the number of iterations). 

For this reason the digital fabrication machines are often used for prototyping in engineering and design. Being able to touch our designs to realize size issues, ergonomics, and aesthetics is a very important step in the process of designing. Before the digital fabrication tools, we had to make both a virtual model in CAD and a physical model. It was necessary to double the work. With the tools we have nowadays, time and effort are cut in half, since the digital file is also used to build the physical model.
