With the current pace of development, there are new technologies surfacing every month, but at the present moment there are two basic
methods of producing an object:

• Adding materials (additive process), layer by layer, to form the complete piece.

• Removing Material (subtractive process), in which the final object is formed by removing the excess from the material block until the
desired shape is achieved.

That also happens in digital fabrication, which has more techniques to remove material than to add it. A saw or drill are examples of 
material removal tools, for example.

_Additive Process:

•	Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
•	Selective Laser Synthering (SLS)
•	Stereolithography (SLA)
•	Inkjet 3D Printing (3DP)
•	Plastic Sheet Lamination (PSL)

_Subtractive Process:

Most digital fabrication machines have a limited amount of work, which determines the maximum size of any part that is manufactured on
the machine. This is important to decide which machine to choose. Sometimes, if a piece does not fit on the machine workload, the 
options are whether to reduce the size of the part (quite common option) or divide the object into several elements (good option when
you need a replica in full size).

Another feature are the axes of work. Most digital fabrication machines have a moving part that moves the desktop to add/ remove the 
material (depending on type of machine). This piece tends to move along one or more axes, just as the print head a common inkjet printer. 
Most machines have between 3 to 5 axes, which determine the complexity of the parts that can be produced.

Depending on the type of machine and the type of material used (metal, plastics, resins, etc.), different accessories may be used. As an
example, certain CNC cutting machines can only carve little hard materials such as foam or plaster, while others have no problem in 
making complex shapes in metal.

In the case of cutting machines, the limits are usually due to the power of the engine capacity and cutting tools (cutters and drills).
In machines that work by material addition, the differences depend on the operating principle, the type of material and the type of 
extruder (a type of tube for molten plastic).
