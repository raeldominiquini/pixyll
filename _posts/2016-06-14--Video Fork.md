### Chicago: city of caustics

As I became interested in the topic of caustics, I began to look for this effect around the city of Chicago. The Windy City was chosen mainly because my research is being developed in this city. A second reason is that since the caustic effect is a result of the interaction between light and water, these two elements can be designated as abundant elements throughout Chicago. Thinking about Chicago is also thinking of the Chicago River, the Lake Michigan and the variety of fountains/ water mirrors that are found around the parks. As a result, I started to walk around the city and look for places where caustics are occurring as a natural effect. 

Certainly, after observing these effects, it is possible to note what are the main factors that can develop the caustics. It is not just about light and water, as isolated causes, but also includes the light intensity, position, angle, and the water clarity and depth. Thereby, I begin to question what can be achieved using these different conditions? Is digital fabrication a method to find what are caustics possibilities?
