summary:    Ideas for the device
---

Through this research I am going to explore kinetic systems while looking for a way to get permanent results out of the ephemeral 
characteristics of wind powered kinetic mechanisms.

The main points that will guide my research are the beauty and ingenuity of kinetic sculptures, such as the Bussola by Jennifer Townley and the wind powered sculptures by Anthony Howe. The main diference between those and the object of my research is that I intend to create an eye pleasant kinetic sculpture that also generates permanent disturbances with its movement, such as a painting or a resultant sculpture.

Bussola - Kinetic Art by Jennifer Townley

The source of energy is intended to be primarily natural, probably trough the wind power, having a backup battery for tests when wind is not available.

When powered, the machine would both translate and move in a horizontal axis. In the extremities of the device there will be a component responsible for affecting a neutral background to reflect the intensity of the wind. That component could be ink over a plain paper, a dissolvent over a certain material or a sculpting device over an easy carving material.

The intention of that machine would be to translate the power of the wind into a visual opportunity that looks visually interesting and ephemeral through the kinetic structure as it moves and at the same time print the interactions in a permanent way.
