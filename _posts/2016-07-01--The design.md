summary:    Design ajustments
---

After studying the movement closely, I drew the movement constraints so I could adjust the design to fit those restrictions.

To do so, I changed the thickness of the central piece. It would no longer have one thickness, but rather concentrated mass in the center
and get thinner and thinner into the extremities.

The new design problem now is how to make the pin that it rotates in a part of the volume.
