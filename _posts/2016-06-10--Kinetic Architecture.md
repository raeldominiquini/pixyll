summary:    Movement + Structural Integrity
---

> Kinetic architecture is a concept through which buildings are designed to allow parts of the structure to move, without reducing overall
structural integrity.

> A building's capability for motion can be used just to: enhance its aesthetic qualities; respond to environmental conditions; and/or, 
perform functions that would be impossible for a static structure.

> The possibilities for practical implementations of kinetic architecture increased sharply in the late-20th century due to advances in
mechanics, electronics, and robotics.
