summary:    The technology applied to Architeture

What enables digital fabrication are Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machines that allow the simultaneous control of several axes, creating an interface that connects the virtual design with its production.

In practical terms, the architect conceives a piece of furniture, for example, and once properly programmed with the design specifications, the machine materializes parts, without the need to operate the machine manually several times.

Ultimately, with the growth of 3D printing objects, also one of the digital manufacturing alternatives, we can produce at the same speed and cost individual articles or thousands of them. "We are only at the beginning," says Fonseca, coordinator of the Research Group on Digital Fabrication Digifab of the Universtity of Sao Paulo, linked to the global network FAB LAB, led by the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

According to Fonseca, the digital manufacturing is a bet that will revolutionize the means of production, but it needs to go beyond new equipment. "We are not announcing new technologies here alone. The coming of the machines that make up the FAB LAB is very important, but we must never lose sight of the collaborative nature of FAB LAB network and our commitment to bringing this technology to the society" he says.
