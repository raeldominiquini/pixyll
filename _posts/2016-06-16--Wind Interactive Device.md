Since I decided to change the direction of the research I started thinking about how I could use a wind interactive façade as an 
architectural resource.

After analyzing how wind is valued and desired in certain climates, I decided to design a façade that responds to the wind in a way that
allows the wind to go through the structure while the wind is blowing and close when there is not enough wind power, so the inside would
be protected from direct insolation and keep it from getting warm.

Tropical countries would take best advantage of the device, as those are warm and sunny almost all year long. The façade would then be 
used to protect from the direct sun and let the wind cool the temperature down at the same time.
