summary:    How Digital Fabrication has changed the way Architecture is made
---

  Digital Fabrication technologies came into the world to revolutionize the way things are done. The new technologies enable a multitude 
of processes and possibilities ranging from the design to the final stages of construction.
 
  In the early days of humanity design was conceived as it was built by the hands of the artist.

  With the evolution of social structures,the intellectual part was separated from labor.

  In the present time, new technologies have made possible the unification of the project as a whole. The design already includes the 
necessary information for its construction. The drawing is no longer a concept, but the object itself in a virtual reality, ready to be
processed and translated through CNC machines to physical reality. Thus the end result is approaching more accurately the project, thanks
to the elimination of the human factor in the construction phase.

  Through this research we will explore the possibilities we have through the use of new technologies of Digital Fabrication as part of 
the design process, and not only the translation from digital to physical.
