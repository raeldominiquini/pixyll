summary:    First design proposal  
---

The first design proposal was thought of in a way that air is captured by the device making it rotate open. It is also simetric in a way
that it is exactly the same when rotated in 180 degrees.

The moving parts would be attached to a frame that would only allow them to rotate in one direction.

A design problem was found when thickness was added to the equation. As I wanted the moving parts to touch the frame, it would not rotate 
due to the thickness.

The next step is to figure out a way to allow it to rotate without the need to have a hole around the whole piece.
