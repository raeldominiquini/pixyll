The work of Jennifer Townley consists mostly of sculptural mechanical constructions, that often move very slowly, usually powered by an 
electric motor. Within kinetic art her work can be distinguished by the slow, subtle, almost peaceful movements and the perfectionistic 
appearance and operation of the machine.

The works derive from her fascination for mechanics and the way the human brain responds to repetitive movements and patterns.
