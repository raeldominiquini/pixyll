summary:    New ideas to explore

Since the last post I decided to change the direction of my research. Instead of using the wind to power my machine I opted for using the
wind as the concept for the design.

Going through the architectural applications for wind interactive devices, I decided an interesting approach to the theme would be to
explore wind interactive facades.

In the next posts I will go through the exploration of the usefulness of the device and where it could make a difference.
