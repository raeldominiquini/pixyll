Contour Crafting is a process of construction of buildings under development by Behrokh Khoshnevis at the University of Southern 
California using a crane or gantry crane controlled by a computer to build buildings quickly and without the use of human handwork.
This concept was originally proposed as a method of building molds for industrial offices. Khoshnevis decided to adapt the technology
for a faster construction of homes as a solution for rebuilding after natural disasters such as the devastating earthquakes that have 
hit Iran, his country of origin.

Using fast construction techniques and materials such as concrete it builds walls layer by layer until the structure is covered by new
ceilings or floors added by the crane. This system allows the insertion of various structural members, piping, wiring, utilities and even
pleasure and comfort audiovisual devices such as air conditioning systems, and in that the wall layers are built.

Khoshnevis says his system could build an entire house in one day and his crane electrically powered would produce little debris resulting
from the construction process. The ‘Discoveries This Week’ program from ‘The Science Channel’ reports that considering that conventional
construction of homes generates 3 to 7 tons of debris and releases polluting gases through the exhaust of its builder vehicles, the 
construction of contours could greatly reduce the environmental impact of construction.
