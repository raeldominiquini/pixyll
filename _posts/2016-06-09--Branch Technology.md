summary:    The technology that will allow us to print structural walls
---

Branch Technology, a Chattanooga, Tennessee-based startup led by Platt Boyd, has become the first company to successfully construct full 
sized building walls with their large robotic arm driven 3D printer. These walls are a modern day version of yesterday’s stale and stagnant
architecture, which has not progressed very much at all over the last several decades.  The latest developments are only made possible 
thanks to 3D printing technology.

Over the course of the last several months, Branch has been able to create some intricate 3D printed demo pieces of their walls. These
walls are based on natural forms, combining light-weight architecture with super strong engineering.

“It bridges art and function and I’m excited to see how it will change the way we think about the spaces where we live and work,”
explains Shawn Thorne of Branch Technology. “We can’t wait to show you what the final products can look like.”

The process of printing these building walls is called Cellular Fabrication™ (C-Fab™), and features Branch’s patented freeform 3D 
printing technology which utilizes a large KUKA robotic arm to print objects in open space, rather than in restricted areas as seen 
with more traditional gantry style 3D printers. It’s much faster, and provides for the ability of virtually unlimited build volumes, 
while using a special algorithm to print very complex geometries without any requirement for support material.

“Branch Technology is taking construction into a new era,” the company explains. “Nature has unlimited creativity. In a similar manner,
Cellular Fabrication™ allows virtually unlimited design freedom using economical construction materials. The result is that all 
construction projects – every home, every office – can enjoy cost effective design freedom.”

Currently Branch is focused mainly on designing and 3D printing unique interior spaces as well as exhibition structures and art
installations, but in the near future they plan to use C-Fab in order to 3D print large load-bearing and exterior walls, as well as 
entire buildings.
