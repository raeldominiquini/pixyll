summary:    Design ajustments

To adjust the design so it would work as desired I created an intermediate layer between the moving parts and the frame.

The layer would be really thin, just to keep the air from passing through. As it's thin, it wouldn't stop the rotation.

The intermediate layer would allow the rotating part to have a single thickness through all of it, making it lasercutter friendly.

After talking to Professor Brett Balogh, who is conducing our research, we decided I should keep looking for a more elegang way to allow 
it to rotate without having to add another layer but rather making the design of the central piece more efficient.
