summary:    How Digital Fabrication has changed the way things are made
---

  Digital Fabrication technologies came into our world to revolutionize the way things are made. The new technologies enable a multitude of processes and possibilities ranging from the design process to the final stages of construction.
 
  In the early days of humanity design was conceived as it was built by the hands of the artist.

  With the evolution of social structures,the intellectual part was separated from labor.

  In the present time, new technologies have made possible the unification of the project as a whole. The design already includes the 
 necessary information for its construction. The drawing is no longer a concept, but the object itself in a virtual reality, ready to be processed and translated through CNC machines to physical reality. Thus the end result is approaching more accurately the project, thanks to the elimination of the human factor in the construction phase.

  Through this research we will explore the possibilities we have through the use of new technologies of Digital Fabrication as part of the design process, and not only the translation from digital to physical.
