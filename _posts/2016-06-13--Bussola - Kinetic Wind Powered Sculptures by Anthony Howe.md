American sculptor Anthony Howe creates kinetic sculptures that once hit by even a slightest whiff of breeze start moving in hypnotizing
circular motions. The artist has been making these skilfully engineered stainless steel pieces for the last 17 years:

> “I attempt, with an economy of means, to construct objects whose visual references range from lo-tech sci-fi paraphernalia to
microbiological or astronomical models. Utilizing primarily stainless steel armatures that are driven either by hammered curvilinear 
shapes or flat fiberglass covered discs, I hope the pieces assume a spare, linear elegance when conditions are still, mutating to raucous
animation when the wind picks up,” says Anthony.
