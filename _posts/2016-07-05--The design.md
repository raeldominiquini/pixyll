In the past days I have been going through the design to figure out the best way to structure the rotating string so it is well attached
to the central piece and yet visually connected to the language of the design.

The new volume would be more easily fabricated through 3d printing because of the changing thicknesses. It could also be made though 
pouring a thermal reactive polymer in a CNC cut mold, but that should demand more time.

I came up with the possibility below, in which the pin is a part of the 3d print. However, after talking to Professor Balogh, we decided
we need something stronger for the pin, such as metal.

Considering that, I rethough the design, so the pin could be attached to the 3d printed part. That way I came up with the design below.
