summary:    How technology is changing the world as we know it
---

Perhaps for many people the word Bioprinting is still unknown, others perhaps have heard, but may not have an accurate concept of what it
means to this new term in the world today. The Bioprint is a technology that is emerging with the advent of 3D printing , and is nothing 
more than printing an exact replica of human organs. 

Many researchers have pooled their efforts to make this technology progress, bringing great results for humanity, bringing 3D printing to 
all points as an alternative that can save many lives. It would provide transplants to people in need, so they wouldnâ€™t have to wait for 
too long.

Despite being a complex technology, it has gained much ground in Medicine. It promises spectacular achievements that can completely change
the life of human beings, replace, repair and even improve the capabilities of the body would be made possible.

3d Bioprint

A company called [Organovo](http://organovo.com/), well known for its contribution to 3D printing, has created organs such as liver 
cells and blood vessels. However, the only downside to this is that the liver was created in miniature, but its functions are completely
equal to having a real one.

Several universities also are studying and bringing this technology advances, many consider that Bioprinting is on track and that there
is still much more work to do. Printing kidneys, ears or hearts will be a total challenge, as will be ensuring that they can be
perfectly located and functioning in the human body is the greatest task.
